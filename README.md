# Battleship

Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of their opponent's warships and sink them.

## How to play
* Each player hides ships on a grid containing vertical and horizontal space coordinates.
* When game starts players take turns calling out row and column coordinates on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a square that contains a ship.
* If the attempt is successful the player calls out another coordinates until he finds out all the hidden ships or his call fails.
* The winner is the first to find out all the hidden ships.
